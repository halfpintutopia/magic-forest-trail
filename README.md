The website is a fan website and has been created solely for the course, but it was inspired by an actual hiking trail based in Braunwald, Glarus-Süd, in the North East of Switzerland. "Zwerg Bartli", a mountain-dwelling    
The dwarf is an affectionately well-known character in this area—a fictitious character made famous by a children's book.

# User Experience (UX)

The site was designed and developed mobile first. 

The idea of the website was inspired by a friend, Hermina Oláh Vass. She and her family are very enthusiastic about the trail. She is motivated to breathe a new breath of life into this local attraction. The idea was to provide an essential website to start her project. and gain support from investors in Braunwald. As due to climate change, the winter season needs to be open to ventures, other than winter sports.

The website consists of the following:

* Home page
* Storybook page
* Form page with a success page
* Trail page
    * Additional pages for each trail shown on the trail cards displayed on the home page
* A 404 page

## Colour Scheme

The colour palette was meant to support a cheerful and natural backdrop to showcase the trails. The colours should complement greens to represent nature and the forest. The red was to represent Bartli's hat. 

Created colour palette using:
* [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/image) 
* [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/image-picker).

![Colour palette for the website](./docs/media/images/design/colour-palette.png)

Feedback from lighthouse testing raised an issue with accessibility and colour contrast. As a result, the red colour was changed on the button with white font. 

## Typography

Permanent Marker and Overpass Fonts were chosen from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com). Fonts were selected to represent fun, playful, clear and easy to read.

![Permanent Marker 400](./docs/media/images/typography/permanent_400.png)

![Overpass 200](./docs/media/images/typography/overpass_200.png)

![Overpass 400](./docs/media/images/typography/overpass_400.png)

![Overpass 600](./docs/media/images/typography/overpass_600.png)

<br>

### References for typography:

When thinking about typography, the type had to suit responsively as well. The fonts had to be also readable on mobile View.

Using Utopia, clamps for fonts and spaces were created. This minimised errors where fonts would be oversized or too small on desktop or mobile devices.

## Imagery

Images are located on all pages. At the top of the page, under the navigation, is the header image. All pages have the same thematic layout, and the layout should be consistent on all pages, including the home page. 

Hiking photos have been used from:

* [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
* [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)


Illustrated images, icons and favicons were generously provided by:

* Hermina Oláh Vass


All images should match the theme of the site, families with children on hiking activities. The hand-drawn illustrations were to support the theme of the trail being inspired by an illustrated storybook. 

To increase the speed of the website., all images were compressed. Also, I added the ```lazy-loading``` attribute to images showing below the fold.

### References for images

* [A Guide to Responsive Images with Ready-to-Use Templates](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/a-guide-to-responsive-images-with-ready-to-use-templates-c400bd65c433)

<br>

Icons were used for social links and buttons. The icons used on the site were taken from:

* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

<br>

The footprints-SVG was created using the SVG from:

* [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com)

* [Footprint](https://pixabay.com/vectors/shoe-print-boot-mark-traces-36730/) by <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/openclipart-vectors-30363/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=155457">OpenClipart-Vectors</a> from <a href="https://pixabay.com//?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=155457">Pixabay</a>

The footprints were created by using GIMP to manipulate the Image, and then the SVG was created with Inkscape.

## General Features on Each Page 

### Specific features

#### Trail List

![Screenshot of the trail (lists) feature](./docs/media/images/features/trail-list/trail_list_mobile.png)

*Screenshot of the trail (lists) feature for mobile*

<br>

![Screenshot of the trail (lists) feature](./docs/media/images/features/trail-list/trail_list_desktop.png)

*Screenshot of the trail (lists) feature for desktop*

<br>

The trail cards displayed contain text descriptions. The height of each card depends on the size of the device. A class was added to shorten the text so that the card heights were manageable on mobile devices. 

#### Gallery

![Screenshot of the gallery feature for mobile](./docs/media/images/features/gallery/gallery_mobile.png)

*Screenshot of the gallery feature for mobile*

<br>

![Screenshot of the gallery feature for desktop](./docs/media/images/features/gallery/gallery_desktop.png)

*Screenshot of the gallery feature for desktop*

<br>

The gallery is in a grid layout masonry style. The gallery was to suit and demonstrate images that are meant to be viewed in portrait or landscape.

### Buttons

#### Call to action

![Screenshot of the cta feature for mobile](./docs/media/images/features/cta/cta_button_mobile.png)

*Screenshot of the CTA feature for mobile*

<br>

![Screenshot of the cta feature for desktop](./docs/media/images/features/cta/cta_button_desktop.png)

*Screenshot of the CTA feature for desktop*

<br>

The button link for the contact form is a floating element on the page. This was changed from the original wireframe, as the CTA button was to be visible wherever the user was on the page. Floating, it made it visible and accessible for visitors to easily click. 


#### Back to trails button

![Screenshot of the back button feature for mobile](./docs/media/images/features/back-btn/back-btn_mobile.png)

*Screenshot of the back button feature for mobile*

<br>

![Screenshot of the back button feature for desktop](./docs/media/images/features/back-btn/back-btn_desktop.png)

*Screenshot of the back button feature for desktop*

<br>

The back button is to enable visitors to go back to the trail card list quickly after viewing the trail page. On mobile, the backlink is always coloured red, but on the desktop, there is a hover effect from white to red. 


#### Explore button

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30613818/208512665-33657fd0-3047-4207-b8a4-384b875249ab.mov

The explore button is located on the landing page. The button takes visitors directly to the trail cards so that they can explore the different hiking trails. 

### Header image

### With statistics (distance, level and time) and a back button

![Screenshot of the header image for trail page with statistics and back button feature for mobile](./docs/media/images/features/header-img/header-img_stats_back-btn_mobile.png)

*Screenshot of the header image for trail page with statistics and back button feature for mobile*

<br>

![Screenshot of the header image for trail page with statistics and back button feature for desktop](./docs/media/images/features/header-img/header-img_stats_back-btn_desktop.png)

*Screenshot of the header image for trail page with statistics and back button feature for desktop*

<br>

The header image should be the first View of the landscape and also quick information about the trail. Showing the distance, approximate time to hike and the level of ease.  

### Trail map

#### Map using leaflet.js

![Screenshot of the trail map on trail page feature for mobile](./docs/media/images/features/trail-map/trail-map_mobile.png)

*Screenshot of the trail map on trail page feature for mobile*

<br>

![Screenshot of the trail map on trail page feature for desktop](./docs/media/images/features/trail-map/trail-map_desktop.png)

*Screenshot of the trail map on trail page feature for desktop*

<br>

The trail map should show all the locations the trail encounters. The trail map markers are custom markers of Bartli.


### text and Image

#### Text Image Sections (with & without quick links)

Version 1:

![Screenshot of the text image feature for mobile](./docs/media/images/features/text-image/feature_image-title-text_mobile.png)

*Screenshot of the text image feature for mobile*

<br>

![Screenshot of the text image feature for desktop](./docs/media/images/features/text-image/feature_image-title-text.png)

*Screenshot of the text image feature for desktop*

<br>

Version 2:

![Screenshot of the text image with quicklinks feature for mobile](./docs/media/images/features/text-image/feature_image-title-text-with-quicklinks_mobile.png)

*Screenshot of the text image with quick links feature for mobile*

<br>

![Screenshot of the text image with quicklinks feature for desktop](./docs/media/images/features/text-image/feature_image-title-text-with-quicklinks.png)

*Screenshot of the text image with quick links feature for desktop*

<br>

There are two versions of the text-image feature. 

The first one can be found on the home page. This is a simple layout of a single image and text. When multiple image text sections are on the same page, they are set to be alternative sides. The text remains in a container, and the Image stretches to either the left or right side, dependent on which side of the text it is positioned. This effect was to fill empty space on wider devices and to add colour.

The second version is seen on the storybook page. The layout is exactly the same. The content is slightly different, as, under each text, there is a link which enables the visitor to quickly go to the trail page if they are interested in visiting the place mentioned in the story.

#### Error in Lighthouse testing

![Best practice error in dark mode](docs/media/images/testing/lighthouse/dark/lighthouse_variation-4_dark_mode_best-practice-error.png)

*Best practice error in dark mode*

<br>

The error states: 

"Image natural dimensions should be proportional to the display size and the pixel ratio to maximise image clarity."

This error looks to be from the map tile, as all the screenshots refer to the Image added by the tile, linked by [vmts.geo.admin.ch](vmts.geo.admin.ch).

## Content

The content created for this website was created by my partner, Stefan Tschudi, a colleague, Hermina Oláh Vass and myself. The story was loosely based on a rough translation of the character based on "Der Zwerg Bartli" by Lorly Jenny. 

All maps were created from actual locations found in [Zwerg-Bartli-Erlebnisweg](https://braunwald.ch/de/map/detail/zwerg-bartli-erlebnisweg-9ff632fe-5eaf-45d9-a6ea-4d743635148f.html). 

The address, email and telephone number on the contact page were made up and are not associated with Braunwald or the story.

The trail is an actual, locally well-known tourist attraction. The trail locations were based on the existing hiking trails in Braunwald, Glarus-Süd in, Switzerland.
