![Screenshot of the site on the Am I Responsive site](./docs/media/images/am_i_responsive.png)

[View the live project here.](https://halfpintutopia.github.io/magic-forest-trail/)

The website is a fan website and has been created solely for the course, but inpsired by an actual hiking trail based in Braunwald, Glarus-SÃ¼d in the North East of Switzerland. "Zwerg Bartli", a moutain dwelling drawf, is an affectionately well know character in this area. A fictitious character made famous by a children's book.

## Colour Scheme

The colour palette should complement greens, to represent nature and the forest. The red was to represent Bartli's hat. 

Created colour palette using:

## Specific features

<details>
<summary>Trail List</summary>
<br>

![Screenshot of the trail (lists) feature](./docs/media/images/features/trail-list/trail_list_mobile.png)

<br>

![Screenshot of the trail (lists) feature](./docs/media/images/features/trail-list/trail_list_desktop.png)

*Screenshot of the trail (lists) feature for desktop*

<br>

The trail list are displayed as cards. The text description length of each card depends on the size of the device. A class was added to to shorten the text, so that the card heights were not too tall on mobile devices. 

</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>Gallery</summary>
<br>

![Screenshot of the gallery feature for mobile](./docs/media/images/features/gallery/gallery_mobile.png)

<br>

![Screenshot of the gallery feature for desktop](./docs/media/images/features/gallery/gallery_desktop.png)

*Screenshot of the gallery feature for desktop*

<br>

The gallery is in a grid layout masonry style. The gallery was to suit and demonstrate images that are meant to be viewed in potrait or landscape.

</details>
<br>


## General features 

<details>
<summary>Call to action</summary>
<br>

![Screenshot of the cta feature for mobile](./docs/media/images/features/cta/cta_button_mobile.png)

<br>

![Screenshot of the cta feature for desktop](./docs/media/images/features/cta/cta_button_desktop.png)

*Screenshot of the cta feature for desktop*

<br>

The button link for the contact form is a floating element on the page. This was changed from the original wireframe, as wanted the CTA button to be visible whereever the user was on the page. Floating it made it visible and accessible for visitors to easily click. 

</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>Text Image Sections (with & without quicklinks</summary>
<br>

Version 1

*Screenshot of the text image with quicklinks feature for desktop*

<br>

There are two version of the text-image feature. 

The first one can be found on the home page. This is simple layout of image and text. When multiple image text sections are on the same page, they are set to be alternative sides. The text remains in a container and the image stretches to either the left or right side, dependendant on which side of the text it is positioned. This effect was to fill empty space on wider devices.

The second version is seen on the storybook page. The layout is exactly the same. The content is slightly different, as under each text, there is a link which enables the visitor to quickly go the trail page if they are interested to visit the place mentioned in the story.
