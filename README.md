# Magic Forest Trail

[View the live project here.]()

The website has been created solely for the course, but inpsired by an actual hiking trail based in Braunwald, Glarus-SÃ¼d in the North East of Switzerland. "Zwerg Bartli", a moutain dwelling drawf, is an affectionately well know character in this area. A fictitious character   made famous by a children's book.  The idea of the website came about, when a colleague, Hermina, enthused about the trail and taking her children to it. She is very motivated in breathing a new breath of life into this attraction and wanted and I thought it would be a win-win to provide a basic website to get her personal project started.

## Design
*Created a prototype for the site with Figma, [here](https://www.figma.com/file/6KQhxGl6q3N0ccFwV6UxXw/PP1?node-id=0%3A1&t=Qqr2DniHOcIOQmPK-1)*

Building from mobile first, I focused on swiping gestures. There are a couple prototype ideas I was playing with but the main idea was to create the landing page with horizontal scrolling. Taking into account new user experiences such as streaming channels like Netflix and phone apps like Tinder, swiping has become quite an expected experience for user.

> Gestures are the new clicks. ...gestures are very effective as they are very natural. With an increasing amount of content on the screens, it is really hard to balance what to have on the screen and what to hide. Using gestures, we can hide the buttons and elements and drive the user to focus more on the content.[[1]][How gestures are shaping the future of UX]

My prototype evolved further when Hermian agreed to provide some beautiful illustration. From the initial image I created the color scheme, the look and feel fo the site.

I initially created two differently stlyed landing pages. This was to try out styles but also to get a feeling about which would be more suitable. Tested the reaction on my partner, and I felt that it did not suit the user story brief. The idea was created as I wanted a synergy between the hand-drawn images, and the illustrated story boook and the content on the page.

## Media
### Compression
*[Created webp images following guide on Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-and-serve-webp-images-to-speed-up-your-website)*
* [An image format for the Web](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp)

Wanted to use webp images due to the size which if too large would slow down the site. Also, added the ```lazy-loading``` attribute. 

Font sizes, margins and paddings were calculated using ```clamp()```, to make the site responsive without having to create media queries.[[2]][[[3]]]

  By choosing to use the top tabbed menus, it makes it easier to see everything available on the site at a glance. As there less then 5 nav items.
  As it is visible it should also stimulate the user to discover more.
