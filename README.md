# Magic Forest Trail

![Screenshot of the site on the Am I Responsive site](./docs/media/images/am_i_responsive.png)

[View the live project here.](https://halfpintutopia.github.io/magic-forest-trail/)

The website has been created solely for the course, but inpsired by an actual hiking trail based in Braunwald, Glarus-SÃ¼d in the North East of Switzerland. "Zwerg Bartli", a moutain dwelling drawf, is an affectionately well know character in this area. A fictitious character   made famous by a children's book.  The idea of the website came about, when a colleague, Hermina, enthused about the trail and taking her children to it. She is very motivated in breathing a new breath of life into this attraction and wanted and I thought it would be a win-win to provide a basic website to get her personal project started.

Wanted to use webp images due to the size which if too large would slow down the site. Also, added the ```lazy-loading``` attribute.

Font sizes, margins and paddings were calculated using ```clamp()```, to make the site responsive without having to create media queries.[[2]][[[3]]]

Font sizing was not being responsive, used clamp()
Color scheme fitting the 70/20/10 ratio, there were too much
Slow loading images use loading lazy and https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-guide-to-responsive-images-with-ready-to-use-templates-c400bd65c433/
