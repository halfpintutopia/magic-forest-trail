# Magic Forest Trail


[View the live project here.]()

The website has been created as for a associate of mine. The hiking trail is based in Braunwald, Glarus-SÃ¼d in the North East of Switzerland. Bartli is a well known mountain dwelling drawf, the fictitious character is based on a children's book. My associate wanted to provide a website to breathe new life into the trail, and attract more visitors during the summer and autumn months.
